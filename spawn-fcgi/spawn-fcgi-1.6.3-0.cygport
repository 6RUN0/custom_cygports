NAME="spawn-fcgi"
VERSION=1.6.3
RELEASE=0
CATEGORY="Web"
SUMMARY="A fastcgi process spawner"
DESCRIPTION="spawn-fcgi allows fcgi processes to be separated from web server process :
  * Easy creation of chmoded socket.
  * Privilege separation without needing a suid-binary,
    or running a server as root.
  * You can restart your web server and the FastCGI applications
    without restarting the others.
  * You can run them in different chroot()s.
  * Running your FastCGI applications doesnâ€™t depend on the web server
    you are running, which allows for easier testing of/migration
    to other web servers."
