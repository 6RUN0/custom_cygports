sdesc: "Net::DNS - Perl interface to the Domain Name System"
ldesc: "Net::DNS is a collection of Perl modules that act as a Domain Name System (DNS) resolver. It allows the programmer to perform DNS queries that are beyond the capabilities of gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.
The programmer should be somewhat familiar with the format of a DNS packet and its various sections. See RFC 1035 or DNS and BIND (Albitz & Liu) for details."
